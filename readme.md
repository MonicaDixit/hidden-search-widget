this exercise teaches how to use transitions
we are using css transition on the width of the input and the translate for the button
basically wht we do is that we start with a small width for the input and position the button absolute so tht it is centered within the input
we attach an event listener to the button click so that when the button is clicked, we add a class called active to the search container
this class changes the width of the input and also translates the button on the x axis.
and we have css transitions defined on the width for the input and on the
transform for the button
